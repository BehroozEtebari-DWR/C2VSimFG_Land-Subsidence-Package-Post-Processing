# C2VSimFG (IWFM Engine) Land Subsidence Package Post-Processing with Python and Post-Processing of existing model C2VSimFG

This repository provides Python tools for post-processing the **Land Subsidence Package** of the **C2VSimFG model** (IWFM engine). The workflow integrates **ArcPy** and **Pandas** libraries for efficient data handling and analysis. 

### Key Features

- Automates data extraction and processing from C2VSimFG outputs.
- Utilizes **ArcPy** for geospatial analysis and mapping.
- Leverages **Pandas** for advanced data manipulation and post-processing.
