# C2VSimFG (IWFM Engine) Land Subsidence Package Post-Processing with Python

This repository provides Python tools for both **post-processing** and **pre-processing** of the **C2VSimFG model** (IWFM engine). It integrates **ArcPy** and **Pandas** libraries for efficient data handling, geospatial analysis, and visualization.

### Post-Processing Scripts

1. **`C2VSimFG - Aquifer_Layering_Params_Subsidence Visualization.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook for visualizing aquifer layering parameters and subsidence data from the C2VSimFG model.  

2. **`Interbeds_thickness_C2VSimFG1.5_analysis.ipynb`**  
   A script designed to analyze and post-process interbed thickness data in the C2VSimFG v1.5 Central Valley Integrated SW-GW Flow Model.

### Pre-Processing Script

1. **`13.1-AEMnWCRs_2_C2VSimFG2_ClayInterbeds_ArcPy.ipynb`**  
   A Python script under development for pre-processing AEM and well completion report data to derive clay interbed properties for the C2VSimFG2 model.  

### Pre-Processing Workflow  

The pre-processing workflow is divided into three steps:  
- **Step 13.1:** Initial data preparation and integration.  
- **Step 13.2:** Further refinement and parameter extraction.  
- **Step 13.3:** Final adjustments for model input readiness.  

### Key Features  

- **Automated Data Extraction:** Simplifies extraction and organization of outputs from C2VSimFG.  
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Leverages ArcPy for mapping and spatial data processing.  
- **Data Manipulation:** Uses Pandas for advanced post-processing tasks.

### Applications  

These tools streamline workflows for analyzing and preparing data from the C2VSimFG model, enabling efficient subsidence analysis, parameter visualization, and preparation for further modeling or reporting.
