# C2VSimFG (IWFM Engine) Land Subsidence Package Post-Processing with Python and Post-Processing of existing model C2VSimFG

This repository provides Python tools for post-processing the **Land Subsidence Package** of the **C2VSimFG model** (IWFM engine). The workflow integrates **ArcPy** and **Pandas** libraries for efficient data handling and analysis. 
C2VSimFG - Aquifer_Layering_Params_Subsidence Visualization.ipynb and Interbeds_thickness_C2VSimFG1.5_analysis.ipynb
are Post-Processing Python scripts for C2VSimFG Central Valley Integrated SW-GW Flow model (IWGM Engine)


### Key Features

- Automates data extraction and processing from C2VSimFG outputs.
- Utilizes **ArcPy** for geospatial analysis and mapping.
- Leverages **Pandas** for advanced data manipulation and post-processing.

### Applications

These tools are designed to streamline workflows for analyzing land subsidence data from the C2VSimFG model, making it easier to derive insights and prepare outputs for further modeling or reporting.
